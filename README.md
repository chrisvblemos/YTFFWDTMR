Fast forward to the most replayed section of a youtube video by pressint ALT+R.
Video will jump to the most replayed peak offset by 1% of video duration (for example, if video has 60 seconds of duration and the peak most replayed time is at 10 seconds, video will jump to 10 - 0.01 * 60 = 9.4 seconds).

Might break when youtube front-end changes...
